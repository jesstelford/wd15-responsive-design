# Design

The "Creative process" seems like a big squiggly line to a lot of managers.

But in reality, it's a series of explorations which go nowhere. Then you backup,
and pick a new path. Eventually ending up with one single straight path.

Instead of dividing teams into skill sets, build complementary teams focused on
small tasks.

Create a _clear understanding_ of the "responsive" process. (See
[workflow](WORKFLOW.md))

Set a "Performance Budget"

* Compare yourself against your competitors
* Must be at least 20% faster to feel to user that page is faster
  * Start render time is the best target

Same for "UX Budget"

* How can you increase conversions?
* Etc

## Responsive Navigation

### Hamburger â–¤

So many ways of getting "Hamburger menu" wrong.

* Eg: close button not where hamburger icon was
  * Some people might like to see the navigation just to get a feel for the
    site.
  * So they might open the menu, then immediately close it.
  * Eg: Chrome's tab `x` is always in the same spot with multiple tabs

#### Case Studies

Caffeine informer's study on hamburger icon found just `[Menu]` ("Menu" with
border) peformed better than Hamburber or combo with "Menu".

Time.com's redesign (and NBC News!). Hamburger menu hides options. Doesn't
matter the button, the items behind it are hidden so the engagement will drop.

Mobile in 2015
* *4-5.5"* screns
* *high resolution* screens
* *portrait* orientation
* *one-handed* grip use
  * But, still; people will often have to use second hand to hit hamburgee menu
* *18.7%* responsive websites
* *botom controls* easier to reach

Facebook's new app moves the buttons to the bottom. The most important actions
are in the middle at the bottom as they're easier to hit.
