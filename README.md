## Responsive Design

2 main problems in Responsive Design:

* Workflow / Teamwork
* Performance

This workshop is about techniques.
And about clever design patterns.
And what works in real-life projects.

Everything is better with:

* `box-sizing: border-box`
* `display: flex`
* `table-layout: fixed`
